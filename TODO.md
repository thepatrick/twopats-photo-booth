# TODO

- When we take a photo:
  - show a printer button on the streamdeck
    - if the user presses the printer button, copy the file to ~/Pictures/PoorMansPhotoBooth/
- auto focus as soon as the user presses the camera
- maybe have an auto focus now button?
- show battery % of camera on streamdeck
- live preview should be centered on screen
- figure out a way to show the back button & preview on the same key

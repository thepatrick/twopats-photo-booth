# TODO

- auto focus as soon as the user presses the camera
- maybe have an auto focus now button?
- show battery % of camera on streamdeck
- live preview should be centered on screen
- figure out a way to show the back button & preview on the same key
- open chrome & make it full screen
- if websocket disconnects show a message (maybe just redirect to a boring html page)
